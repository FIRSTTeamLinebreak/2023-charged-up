# 2023 Robot Code for Team Linebreak

## Purpose

Code contained in this repository was made to control our robot for the 2023 FRC competition.

## Development

### Code Style

This project uses [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.org) for code style enforcement and linting along with [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

#### VSCode Setup

1. Download the checkstyle plugin by [ShengChen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle)
2. Set the configuration file to `${workspaceFolder}/checkstyle.xml`
3. Set the version to `10.6.0`
4. Write code

Instructions on how to report errors and warnings via a CLI are in the works.

#### Modifications From Google's Java Style Guide

+ Indentations use 4 spaces instead of Google's 2
+ Line limit is 300 chars instead of Google's 100

### Spelling

In order to prevent spelling errors, this project uses [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker). Please install and enable this plugin in VSCode to prevent spelling errors.
